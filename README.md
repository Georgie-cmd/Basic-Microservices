All rigth, that's a basic example about creating microservices by TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

## Installing
First of all: open each folder in turn and run
> $ npm install

After that you must run each server, run this command in each file:
> $ npm run start:dev

Open postman and try to send a POST request with fields: email and password in JSON and check your terminals. Enjoy!
